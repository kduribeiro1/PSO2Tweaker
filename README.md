PSO2Tweaker
===========

A replacement for the normal PSO2JP Launcher, used to update and launch the original Japanese version of the game with patches, modifications, troubleshooting, and much more.

Still getting things set up here, and I'll apologize in advance for my horrible, horrible, code. ;w; This is my first .NET project, so... yeah.

## Requirements
DotNetBar v8.2.0.2 (Or any compatible version) for the GUI (DevComponents.DotNetBar2.dll v2.0.50727)
